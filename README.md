# Transportation-Scheduling-Route-Mapping-Platform



Efficient transportation scheduling and route mapping are essential for improving urban mobility. Many public transport systems still depend on manual planning, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and resource mismanagement. This project introduces a Transportation Scheduling and Route Mapping Platform, designed to optimize scheduling, route planning, and resource allocation using Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies.
The platform provides automated duty scheduling for transport personnel, dynamic route planning, and real-time schedule adjustments to enhance efficiency. It leverages Google Maps API for interactive map visualization, allowing transport managers to design optimized routes, avoid congestion, and ensure effective utilization of vehicles and crew. The system integrates a MySQL database to manage schedules, user roles, and transport data efficiently.
Through a user-friendly web-based interface, administrators can assign duties, track performance, and generate analytics-driven reports for data-backed decision-making. The system also supports real-time tracking (optional) to improve operational transparency and adherence to schedules.
By reducing manual effort, scheduling errors, and redundant routes, this platform significantly enhances the reliability of transport services. The projectâ€™s implementation includes requirement gathering, system design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance to ensure robustness and scalability. In conclusion, this system will streamline public transport scheduling, minimize inefficiencies, and optimize resource allocation, leading to improved service coverage and commuter experience.
